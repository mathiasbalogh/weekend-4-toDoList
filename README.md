**To Do List**


-This app allows the user to create a To Do List with creation dates, as well as edit the tasks that have previously been created. Upon completion of the task a completed checkbox can be checked which will populate the completed on date field. Finally if the task would like to be discarded, it can be removed entirely. 

-This is the first solo project we have created that is a full CRUD application that spans the entire stack.
